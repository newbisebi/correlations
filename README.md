# correlations
A script to display a correlation table with pvalues and significance :

\* -> 10% significance

\** -> 5% significance

\*** ->1% significance


As I couldn't find a way to display all correlations in a unique table with the p-value and significance level, I wrote this. 

I am kinda new to Python so it can surely be improved a lot!
